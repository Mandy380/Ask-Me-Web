          artificial intelligent</a
        >
        techniques and technologies into video games to create more dynamic,
        responsive, and immersive gameplay experiences. It involves programming
        computer-controlled characters
        <span>(non-player characters or NPCs)</span> and entities within the
        game environment to exhibit intelligent behaviors, make decisions, and
        interact with the player and the game world in a lifelike manner. Think
        of it as a virtual mind for the characters and components in a video
        game, breathing life into the digital realm and making it interactive,
        almost as if you're engaging with real entities.
